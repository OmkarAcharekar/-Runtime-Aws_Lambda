# Runtime-Aws_Lambda



Runtime for [Amazon Web Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html) also library for creating runtimes.

The default runtime implementation shipped  lets you write native Rust event handlers for AWS Lambda.
 
Your handler code gets compiled along with the runtime into a single executable file which is deployed to the Lambda service.

It keeps dependencies and complexity to a minimum and does not depend on `tokio`. Writing `Runtime-Aws_Lambda` functions is simple and easy.
